0,1528215582.0,yarr,Ethereum - Likely Push to 900$. Third Wave in Progress.,"




20 hours ago




Here is a longer term perspective on  Ethereum -0.82% . The market has had a minor decline along with the  bitcoin -0.20%  market after it got rejected by 0.382 fib level. It’s essential that the price breaks above it to give us  bullish  confirmation. If it’s not able to break upwards from the 0.382 fib level, it’s likely to test  support zone  at $500.00 - $530.00 and move lower. 

In the chart above what is notable is that the price is sitting above of MA9, MA13 crossover and inside of the  support zone  while selling power is declining. This signals that the price wants to push higher and before it’s able to do so it needs to take 0.382 fib level down first.  

If you need any help with trading, recommendations or where to search basics just feel free to leave me  DM -1.14%  -2.27% 0.78% in here or in my twitter. I try to respond ASAP! :)  
Happy trading!  

Things to Remember:  
Stop-loss orders are strongly recommended.  
Beware of buying tops or FOMOS, you might end up losing or waiting long periods of time before getting anything back.

1,1528196687.0,TheChartGuys,ETH Hourly EMA 26 resistance for bulls to turn to support,"
ETH has multiple hourly inside bars about to break to determine short term direction.  
The pullback from the high of the bounce is still less than 50% while  BTC -0.20%  and LTC are greater than 50% 
BTC -0.20%  is struggling with  EMA  12 while ETH is showing  relative strength  and is 1 level up to  EMA  26.  
We will still need  BTC -0.20%  to change the hourly trend for the ETH bulls to give the daily candle a nice lower wick.  
Bulls need to set low of day this morning and see a slow bounce today for the  daily chart  to continue to hold the trend change possible. 
Currently in a patience setup, unless any bulls are trying to enter on the daily higher low, which we still are not confident in until the hourly trend changes at the very least.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a wonderful weekend.  

Let's analyze ETH/USD on the 1D chart  

Ethereum              is falling at a side-wards resistance line on the  daily chart  at 625 level. Price is also under 20 moving average resistance simultaneously. The averages are still separated suggesting the trend is still down, so we need to be mindful of this before immediately assuming to take a long position in the future. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum              at this stage, which I have outlined below:  

-  Ethereum              falls from current levels into a key hidden  support level  at 470, before retesting and breaking to the upside. With this scenario breaking out of structure is more likely than the below scenario because we are nearer the side-wards  resistance level  and less momentum is needed to breakout. 
-  Ethereum              continues current fall into the lower horizontal  support zone  at 356, before bouncing to the upside. With this scenario it may be slightly harder to break out of side-wards resistance line because it would take much more bull participation and consistency to successfully breakout. 

Although scenario 2 is better for short term upside, I'd rather see scenario 1. Why? Scenario 1 relies on a hidden  support level  that isn't as strong as the level that would be tested on scenario 2.  

I will update this analysis when I receive above 40 likes.

Note the low of this consolidation does not HAVE to hold, that would just be ideal for bulls.  
Keep an eye on the ETHBTC chart as we are looking for some more short term clarity on who the leader is.  
There have been two instances in the last 24 hours where ETH has shown bulls to be a bit more explosive than  BTC             .  
Patient traders are waiting for more clarity on the short term pattern as we patiently wait for bulls to prove themselves. 
Remember we need a daily higher high to confirm the trend change and weekly higher low.

In this video, I will show you how you can change the Martin  Trend Line  Candle indicator settings to show more profitable trades simply by increasing the input number.  

What I suggest to everyone is that you start with the setting of 8 and then increase and decrease this number to see what works best for your ticker. The lower the input number, the longer the candle runs will be which gives you more of a swing trading type of approach. Increasing this numbers will give you more frequent trades to take.  

What I do is open my chart on a ticker, activate the Martin  Trend Line  Candle indicator, and then tweak the indicator until I see a good pattern forming where the candles have nice long runs where I can enter and exit for good profit. There is no magical number to use, it comes down to taking the time to find a good setting for each ticker. I've spent an entire day finding the right setting on some tickers. It takes some time, but once you get it dialed in, the trades are amazing!

- Pattern 'cloning' such as this one occurs on a regular basis  
- Low probability of occuring, market fundamentals do NOT support it

					What is the basis for a rise from the POV of manipulation? 

Assuming these are huge players... 

I think that a false bull run to say.. 9000 would get world attention. 

At that point, institutional investors will excited and eager. On the other hand, Wallstreet is not ready to get in just yet, they want the price to TANK so they can buy in cheap.  

This tactic hold both factors in check.. 

Then from this 'false top' a big manipulated price drop steals coins from panicked long positions. In turn, institutional investors cringe, further delaying their involvement. 

How long would such a boom and bust cycle continue? Who knows.. but until regulation and big money jumps in.. the market is a sitting duck.

					Some potential events that could drive the price in either direction.. 

In spite of what most TA theorists will claim, REAL NEWS does affect the price and good market sentiment summaries for the week (as long as it is NOT fake news) is a bonus to price rises. 

One would think these will have good outcomes in the news 

- June 4 to forever - Ripple donated $50 ln to Universities to speed up adoption 
- June 5 to 13 - G7 Summit in Quebec 
- June 5 - Indonesia approves trading as a Commodity 
- June 5 to Infinity - USA's SEC approves new crypto chief and it's a woman :) 
- June 5 to Infinity - Coinbase launching in Japan 
- June 5 to Infinity - DHL is joining the blockchain movement 
- June 5 to infinity - ICO crackdown, big exchanges hailing this as good 
- June 5 - sudden BTC price rise just defied this morning's news 

There are also more significant industry events coming during June.

 Bitcoin              made it's moves. Now it's also time for  Ethereum              to shine - a bit. At least we can say seeing the potential is has. 

Let's begin with what happened recently: We had a bounce at the MA50 just as  Bitcoin              did and  Ethereum              moved up. There is even a breakout of the big  trendline  (after breakout there might be a little consolidation.  

What comes next is probably an uptrend to ~660 level - for now. At ~660 USD there are two big resistances: a) fibonacci level and b) MA200.  

Seeing how high the potential with  MACD  is, we can say that it could work out. It appears that there is a  MACD  cross coming marking another up move and  RSI  is also still not in oversold area.

13,1528219547.0,ruud_one,ETH:USD Completing Inverse Head and Shoulders?,"
TL:DR - We are nearing completion of right shoulder in a  bullish inverse Head and Shoulders  patter which has the potential to take us to $700 (but I am doubtful we get there).  I am buying with an initial profit target of $660. 

This is the Eth:USD chart with 4 hour candles.  On my last post I used 1 hour candles and talked about the  inverse H&S  pattern but didn't chart it until later on in the post.  Price has since started to finish the right shoulder of the  inverse head and shoulders  pattern.  The neckline is at about $623 which is above both the 10 MA and he dotted red downtrend line. 

To calculate a price object in any  Head and Shoulders  pattern take the distance from the peak of the head to the neckline.  This distance is the general range price will move up or down upon break out of the  H&S .  I conservatively measure a price movement of $80 and with the expected neckline breakout of $623 then this  inverse H&S  pattern has the potential to take us to $700. 

I am doubtful price will make it to $700 and have a more conservative target of $660 - $680.  I am buying now as we finish the right shoulder.  Did I sell at $696 just 2 days ago? Yes, we were heading for a break of the 10MA and I wanted to protect profits in case the  inverse H&S  was invalid.   I am now more confident it is valid and comfortable buying back in at a slightly higher price. 

IF we go  bullish  I will watch the  volume  and price action.  A big spike in  volume  and we may in fact make it to $700.  If we move up on low  volume  then I will be quick to sell at any sign of a reversal. 

What if we break to the downside?  It's entirely possible and I will have stop losses placed to protect against large losses but my current gut feeling is  bullish  based off of the chart.

Ethereum              followed the other allies and went downwards on Monday after weekend’s rally, which was a part of an upside correction to the midterm downtrend. ETH/USD has lost more than two percent in the past 24 hours and is able to develop this negative tendency in the nearest future. If the upside correction is done, ETH/USD will likely to develop its downside progress. 





		Let’s have a closer look at what is happening on the Hourly chart. ETH/USD has reached $626.66  resistance area  during the weekend but was unable to cross it. The currency pair has started a short term downside correction on Monday, which looks like the downtrend in the moment of writing as ETH/USD has broken through the green ascending  trend line .  Ethereum              was stopped at $566.90  support area , which coincides with 2. 618 retracement  level. What are the possible ways for ETH/USD? 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will break through $566.90 and move lower targeting $540.69  support area .  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral). ETH/USD will test the closest  resistance area  at $596.08 and jump off it targeting the closest  support area  at $566.90. The currency pair will stay within this range with no significant fluctuations. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ).  Ethereum              will break through the  resistance area  at $596.08 and move higher targeting the next  resistance area  at $626.66, which coincides with 1. 618 retracement  level.

 Ethereum              couldn't keep up past week's uptrend, and cross the 38% Fib level, at $624. This level is also well defended by the red (21 bar) and blue (55 bar) lines, and by the resistance line (in orange), which was tested and rejected 3 times.  

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $574) and the pink (144 bar) line. Those mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting ETH can keep going sideways for the moment. 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is quickly decreasing, during the past days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is pointing down to signal that  Ethereum              needs to correct before another reversal. 

Today ETH briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back. This could be a trend continuation signal. If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($492) is probable. Just below $492 levels, ETH has $427 and $367 as a previous support region. 

In another scenery, a break and close above orange  trendline  is needed for buyers to take control. Above $640 the next stop for buyers could be around the $665 level, where price was traded in the end of April, before the rally to the $838 level.

17,1528222529.0,This_Guhy,ETH with extraordinarily Bullish 4H chart,"
Sometimes while going through the charts I get a literal adrenaline dump, heart racing and the shakes when I see a chart set up.  This is one of them.  The 4H  MACD  circled in yellow is on its way to have a  bullish  cross ""in the air"" above zero after just crossing the zero line.  We can see what happened in green when instead of crossing through the signal line it bounce off.  The red circles show the in the air  bullish  crosses after already experiencing a relative peak above zero.  If the next two months are similar to the last two months we will see  ETHUSD -0.82%  near 1k but given the previous resistance at 840-ish that may be an optimistic scenario. 

If we don't have this  bullish MACD  cross I will have a visceral response in the opposite direction but I think the odds of that happening are slight.  The  RSI  in both green and yellow bounce off overbought conditions and layed the breathing room (psychologically) for us to go deeper into overbought conditions.  I suspect we will lance into overbought conditions 2 or 3 times with the  RSI  bouncing lower and lower before breaking down completely, as it did the last time around.  As I say repeatedly, the bull run will end when we see the RSI/MACD price divergence break down on the  daily chart .
