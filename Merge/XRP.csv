Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year).

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength.

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session.

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session.

Set a tight stop loss, yes its better to get stopped out 10 times an eventually ride the winning trade while you ""learn"". This will eventually build your confidence and help you in understanding the market better in the long run.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

I mentioned this morning a slight concern about the topping LOI pattern I saw. It broke down during this 4H bar. That said, I do not see it as an indication at this time of any significant downward movement.  

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up. 

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume .

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

There is a new  Bullish Ascending Triangle  on the chart. It terminates in 20 hours. These things never go to full termination, so I expect some break one way or another in the next 8, probably during the Asian session. It is a  bullish  formation, and we should be in Wave 3, so it should be breaking up.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

Ripple has been consolidating for the last week in a gradual manner. If you look at the price action, there have been a series of slightly higher highs without any significant BULL candles. Overall, to me this doesn't look like any sort of bull run. 

The area shaded in grey is a consolidation zone from a previous breakout to the down side. As price has now returned to this level, there is a good chance there is still unfilled sell orders and selling pressure. The  rising wedge  leading into this area supports this interpretation as buyers are gradually losing strength. 

Should this be the case, we could see a smack down to at least the 31% retracement level. The  rising wedge  pattern might have a bit further to go before we have a confirmed signal to short.  

Take a look at the  RSI  too, which is declining, while the price of Ripple has been gradually increasing. 

Similarly, i'm watching to see if the  pennant  pattern will complete. This give us a breakout pattern to short to the downside and a projected target (indicatively shown) at 0.62. 

For the aggressive traders, now might be the time to gradually enter into a short position.  Will post updates.

We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.

Should... so... it can also break down. Either way, these formations, and  Pennants , usually precede significant moves.  

Ready. Set. Go.

1000,1000,1528376662.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Monthly Pivot Barrier - LOI Recovers,"
We quickly recovered from that single bar dip yesterday and actually poked above Wave 1 high, though by a tiny fraction. Right now there are no technicals limiting us from more upward movement except for the Monthly  Pivot .  

LOI also recovered and made a new high, though again I am seeing a flat top forming again like I did yesterday preceding that short dip. 

The crypto market as a whole appears to be up, with $XRP leading the pairs on  Bitstamp  and gaining another 0.31% over #Bitcoin.  

I am expecting a move above the Monthly  Pivot  today at 0.69372, culminating at 0.73 by the end of tomorrow, though a 3-day impulse wave isn't outside the norm recently, so it could be as late as Friday.  

I want to touch on the upcoming Wave 4 for a moment. With it so near the Monthly  Pivot , and near the start of the month, I can see Wave 4 potentially testing the Monthly  Pivot , which is also the 0.5 fib of the predicted Wave 3.  

The only wave I try to capitalize on is Wave 5 and Wave A, selling at Wave 5 and buying at Wave A. Trying to catch a 0.03 move is tricky, and from experience I end up just loosing some of my overall position. The goal here is to build up as much XRP as possible. For those of you who can magically call the exact top and bottom, congrats, but I usually estimate Im going to loose 0.01 off the top and 0.01 off the bottom at a minimum.. so catching that 0.01 left of the 0.03 may or may not be worth the effort and risk to overall position.

In order for you to become a better trader you would need to understand that if you step into this ring (accepting risk) expecting not to take hits and continue delivering OK's you should stop trading.

Set a tight stop loss, yes its better to get stopped out 10 times an eventually ride the winning trade while you ""learn"". This will eventually build your confidence and help you in understanding the market better in the long run.

XRP got retraced rejected at the 38% Fib level, priced at $0.69. This level is also well defended by the red and pink lines, acting as a resistance. 

Below that, we find the 23% level (at $0.63). All these mentioned lines are flat now, suggesting that Ripple may keep going sideways for the moment. 

During the past 3 days, XRP briefly touched the 23% Fib level, before bouncing back to the next level, creating a period of consolidation in these ranges. This could be a trend continuation signal, if accompanied by a large increase in  volume . 

Volume  on the  daily chart  is decreasing, since last days when this rally started, which signs a  bearish  divergence.  RSI  is neutral, at 50.  MACD , on the other hand, is increasing positively. 

If it fails, a further dip to retest the lower levels ($0.54), or the pink line at $0,67, is likely. Just below $0.54 levels, Ripple has $0.45 as a previous support region (the lowest point this year). 

In another scenery, a break and close above $0.69 is needed for buyers to take control. The next stop for buyers could be around the $0.73 level, the %50 Fib level and the blue line. For this breakout though, we need a bigger  volume  to create enough momentum.
