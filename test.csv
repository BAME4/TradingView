My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

1,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.83%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.83%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

2,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -0.83%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

3,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.83%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.83%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.83%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.83%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.83%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.83%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

13,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.84%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.84%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.84%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.84%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

21,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.88%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.88%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
31,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.89%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.89%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

33,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.89%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.89%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.89%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.89%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

Bitcoin -0.89%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2.

Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
51,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.95%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.95%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

52,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -0.95%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.95%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.95%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
61,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.13%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.13%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.11%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.11%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
81,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.05%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.05%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

82,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.05%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

83,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.04%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.04%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.04%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.04%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.04%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.04%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave!

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

101,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
111,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

112,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

113,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month

Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

131,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

141,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.11%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.11%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

142,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.11%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

143,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.11%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.11%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.11%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.11%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

153,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.14%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.14%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.14%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.14%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

161,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.37%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.37%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

171,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.40%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.40%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.40%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.

173,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.40%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.40%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.40%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.40%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)

6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

191,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.29%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.29%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.29%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.

But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

201,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.34%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.34%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

203,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.38%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.38%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.38%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.38%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA

Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

221,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.30%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.30%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

222,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.30%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

223,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.30%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.30%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon.

The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that???

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

231,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.30%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.30%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

233,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.30%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.30%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.30%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.30%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
251,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.40%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.40%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

252,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.40%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

253,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.40%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.40%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.40%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.40%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

261,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.45%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.45%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.45%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.45%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame.

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.  










",Short
281,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.51%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.51%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

282,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.51%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

283,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.55%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.55%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.55%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.55%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.55%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges:

Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.55%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month

Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

301,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.52%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.52%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume.

311,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.48%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.48%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

312,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.48%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

313,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.48%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.48%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.48%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.49%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.49%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.49%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.49%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china!

Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now.

The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support.

As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

331,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.45%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.45%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)

1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume.

",Short
341,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.51%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.51%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

342,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.51%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

343,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.48%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.48%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.45%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china!

Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support.

As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

361,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.

d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

371,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.46%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.46%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.46%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

373,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.48%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.48%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.48%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.49%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.49%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target.

Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support.

The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

391,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.

d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

",Short
401,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.52%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.52%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.55%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.

403,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.57%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.57%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.57%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.57%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.57%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.57%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.70%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave!

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

421,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

",Short
431,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.61%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.61%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

432,"BTC Potential 4 Hour Bull Flag
 BTC -1.61%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

433,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.61%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.61%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.61%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.61%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.73%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.73%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.73%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.73%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target.

Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

451,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.

d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume.

",Short
461,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.76%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.

",Short
463,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.76%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.76%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.76%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.76%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.79%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.79%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target.

Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support.

The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

481,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.

d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top

Not only did  BTC -1.70%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume.

",Short
491,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.78%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.

",Short
493,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.78%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.78%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.78%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.78%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave!

6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support.

As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

511,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

",Short
521,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.77%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.

523,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.77%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.77%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.77%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.77%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave!

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):

The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.

551,"2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!




Jun 7




In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.78%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.78%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC              is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.

553,"13 Reasons Why of Bitcoin




Jun 7




The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.78%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.78%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.78%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.78%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

560,"ETH/USD - Live Update
What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.06%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

",Short
561,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.06%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

The possible scenarios remain the same as yesterday since there was almost no change in price.

632,"ETH/USD - Live Update
What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.13%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.13%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

633,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD -0.13%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

 ETHUSD -0.16%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.13%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.13%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD              update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum 0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD 0.01%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.25%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.25%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.23%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum 0.07%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum 0.07%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

786,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD 0.07%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.28%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.28%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

822,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD -0.28%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.34%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.34%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.34%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down.

But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.33%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.33%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.33%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.44%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.44%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.44%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.52%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.52%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.52%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.80%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.80%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.80%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.80%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.80%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.

ETH has a bit more work to do to be as close to daily continuation as  BTC -0.61%  is.  
The ETHBTC chart is getting extremely tight with 3 daily inside bars. Watch this chart for the break.  
Bulls need to see continuation today, and the ETH chart is much more split than  BTC -0.61%  which favors bulls.  
Some hourly inside bars to watch here for short term direction.  
Added another small position on the 4 hour  IB 0.93%  bull break last  night, and will exit if we lose the daily low of consolidation.  
Still mostly patient in the tightening daily range.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

1010,"ETH/USD - Live Update
What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.78%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.78%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

1011,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD -0.77%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

1037,"ETH/USD - Live Update
What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.81%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.81%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

1038,"ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.
 ETHUSD -0.81%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.

 LTCUSD -1.49%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.77%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.77%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.72%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence.

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.35%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.75%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.75%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control.

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.30%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.63%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.63%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.45%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.68%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.68%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure).

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.65%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure).

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

1569,"Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

The pair has not been able to move very far from the Central  Pivot Point  due to the low  volume  and the immediate supports of the day are $ 0.003282 $ 0.003200. A close of the next candle above the Central  Pivot Point  could give the pair a boost to look for resistances in the green zone in the short term and the 50% of the  Fibonacci Retracement  as the final target.

DOGE continues its slow rise in the chart and it seems that it has already exceeded the 100-EMA today and although it had a high  volume , the result was a  volatility  that only gave higher long shadow candles that indicate dominance of the buyers. In this 4 hour chart we see how the last candle can be definitive in the price direction, a close above the 100-EMA can indicate buyer's pressure and a possible long entry.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.

					""I am fond of telling the tale of the inventor of chess and his patron, the Emperor of China. 

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero?

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero?

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero?

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero?

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero?

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.
